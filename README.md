## Summary
  The Election Analysis script I provided is a value script that could be used in the future. Other voting districts could be analyzed if a different data set was provided. 
  We could also add in additional analysis like the number of votes each candidate recieved in each county. The options are numerous if you have additional data i would be happy     to use this tool to analyze it.
